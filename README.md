# reCAPTCHA_Form

This is source code to implement Google reCAPTCHA. For your information, reCAPTCHA is a free service that protects our website from spam and abuse. reCAPTCHA uses an advanced risk analysis engine and adaptive CAPTCHAs to keep automated software from engaging in abusive activities on our site.

For implementing this, I follow a tutorial from Youtube. If you want to try it, please visit this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmMG7_LcQHc&t=63s. His tutorial is easy to understand and very informative. Good luck.
